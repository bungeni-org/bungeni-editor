[Bungeni Editor v1.1.2268- requires OpenOffice.org 3.3.0](http://bungeni-editor.googlecode.com/files/install-1.1.2268.jar) - Mar 16 2012 - Interim release, expect a more updated release shortly
  * UI and performance improvements.
  * Changes to configuration interface : the embedded database for configuration is being gradually deprecated - all the action configuration has been moved to a more accessible configuration xml ; configuration aspects have been simplified;
  * Transformation engine upgrades : the transformer now uses a single point of configuration to modify and customize pipelines;
  * Numbering / Renumbering : this has been rewritten to do off-screen renumbering. On-screen renumbering was resource intensive - and didnt scale well with large documents [NOTE: UNSTABLE - still being tested ]
  * Schema : preliminary update to AN 2.0 [NOTE: UNSTABLE - still being tested ]
