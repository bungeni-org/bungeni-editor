#summary How to build bungeni editor from source
#labels Featured

= Pre-requisites =

 * Sun Java 6 JDK
 * Ant
 * OpenOffice.org 3.0.1

= Building from source =

== SVN checkout == 

Create a folder for the editor source, and then check the source out into it :
{{{
svn co http://bundeni-editor.googlecode.com/svn/BungeniEditor/trunk/BungeniEditorClient
}}}

== Build == 

We use ant for building the project.  The build script takes a parameter specifying the path to the openoffice installation :

{{{
ant -buildfile build-cmdline.xml -Dopenoffice.org.root=/opt/openoffice.org/basis3.0 jar
}}}

This creates the editor jar file 'BungeniEditorClient.jar' under the dist folder.
