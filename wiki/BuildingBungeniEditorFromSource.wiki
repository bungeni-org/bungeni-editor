#summary How to build bungeni editor from source

= Pre-requisites =

 * Sun Java 6 JDK
 * Ant
 * OpenOffice.org 3.1.1

= Building from source =

== SVN checkout == 

Create a folder for the editor source, and then check the source out into it :
{{{
svn co http://bundeni-editor.googlecode.com/svn/BungeniEditor/trunk/BungeniEditorClient
}}}

== Ant Build == 

We use ant for building the project.  The build script takes a parameter specifying the path to the openoffice installation :

{{{
ant -buildfile build-cmdline.xml -Dopenoffice.org.root=/opt/openoffice.org/basis3.0 jar
}}}

This creates the editor jar file 'BungeniEditorClient.jar' under the dist folder.

== Netbeans Build == 

You can also use netbeans to build / debug the source.

Netbeans build has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04 and Windows XP (It will *not* work on Mac OS X).

 * Install Netbeans 6.5.1
 * Install the OpenOffice.org SDK for OpenOffice.org 3.1.1
 * Install the Openoffice.org plugin from the netbeans update center
 * Check out the Bungeni Editor project from svn 
 * Open the Bungeni Editor project from within netbeans - and run in debug mode
