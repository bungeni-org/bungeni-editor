#summary Setting up Netbeans API libraries for BungeniEditor
#labels BungeniEditorClient

External libraries used for building the Editor are located here :

http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/BungeniOOo/external_libs/

You need to import the library mappings into netbeans so that editor project can recognize the correct location of the libraries, these mappings are located here as XML files:

http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/BungeniOOo/external_libs/netbeans_support

After checking out the mappings folder, open a terminal window and switch that folder.
You need to set the absolute path to the path where your external_libs folder is located.
If your external libs folder is under : /home/undesa/projects/external_libs

then you need to prefix that path to the library path, do this using the following command

{{{
find -name '*.xml' -print0 | xargs -0 perl -pi -e 's/lib_path/\/home\/undesa\/projects/g'                                                
}}}

In the above command, lib_path is the prefix to be replaced with the actual path.
You also need to set the prefix path for the openoffice libraries (located within the openoffice installation on your computer. To do this run the following command:

{{{
find -name '*.xml' -print0 | xargs -0 perl -pi -e 's/oo_path/\/opt\/openoffice/g'                                                
}}}

The above command uses oo_path as the prefix to replace with the path to the OOo installation under /opt/openoffice.

Finally copy the mapping XML files to your :

 <home>/<username>/.netbeans/<version number>/config/org-netbeans-api-project-libraries/Libraries 

Now if you restart netbeans the project external library mappings should be correctly set.
