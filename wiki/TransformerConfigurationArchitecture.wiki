#summary This page describes the configuration architecture of the bungeni document transformer
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The Bungeni Transformer uses XSLT to convert a ODT document to AkomaNtoso.
Structural markup & metadata is transformed to akomantoso elements and attributes.

= System Components = 

The primary system components involved in the transformation process are as follows :

 * ODFDOM - this is the open source ODF processing library provided by Sun
 * Saxon - this is the open source XSLT 2.0 transformer written by Michael Kay
 * Xerces - this is the DOM processor
 * Restlet - this is used to provide a REST based API layer on the transformer. Client integration of the transformer is done over http using the restlet http client API.

The transformer is a java jar application with a fixed manifest. _Perhaps this needs to be changed into a standard class library without a hard-coded manifest_.

= How the Transformer Works = 

 # *Input Document* - The input document is a marked up ODT document. The documents are 
marked up using the Bungeni Editor. Markup appears in the ODF in the following form ; The following is the ODF source for a marked up speech. The speech is marked out as a named section. Metadata is associated via the style-properties of the section :
