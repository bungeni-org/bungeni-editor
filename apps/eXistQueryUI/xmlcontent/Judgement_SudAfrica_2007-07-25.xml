                    This appeal is against the Ruling of the High Court delivered on the 6<span class="sup">th</span>
                    February, 2007. In the Ruling, the learned trial judge dismissed the election petition of 
                    the appellant on a preliminary point of law.
                    For convenience, the appellant shall be referred to as the petitioner, 
                    while the 1<span class="sup">st</span> and the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> 
                    respondents shall retain their positions as this is what they were in the court below.
                </p></introduction><background><p>
                    The brief facts, common to both sides and which gave rise to the preliminary issues, 
                    were that the petitioner stood as a parliamentary candidate in the Malole Constituency in the 
                    Northern Province. Being dissatisfied with the election results, she instructed counsel to 
                    petition and a petition was duly filed. 
                    After a few days, an amended petition was filed. According to the record, all this was done 
                    within 30 days in compliance with 
                    <ref id="ref12" href="/zm/act/2006/12/eng@/main.xml#sec96">Section 96 of the Electoral Act No. 12 of 2006</ref> 
                    (hereinafter to be referred to as "the Act").
                    The petition, among other things, sought to declare the election of the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> 
                    respondent null and void; declare the appellant as the duly elected Member of 
                    Parliament for Malole Constituency and, therefore, entitled to take her seat in the 
                    National Assembly and enjoy all the benefits due to that office.
                </p></background><motivation><p><noteRef href="#not1" num="1"/><omissis>...</omissis></p><p>
                    The preliminary issues, as points of law, were disposed of through submissions by counsel 
                    representing the parties to the election petition. Mr. Lisimba, counsel for the 
                    2<span class="sup">nd</span> respondent, submitted first because he had formally filed the 
                    2<span class="sup">nd</span> respondent's notice to raise preliminary issues. 
                    According to the record, the formal notice was in response to the learned trial Judge's 
                    observations as to what status to accord the election petition that was not signed by the 
                    petitioner herself in compliance with the provisions of Section 96(3) of the Act.
                </p><p>
                    The preliminary issues raised were in three parts. Without reproducing them, we shall, 
                    for the purposes of this appeal, take the first one, which was
                    not only vigorously argued before the lower court and this court but which is also the 
                    subject of appeal.
                </p><p>
                    As recast by counsel for the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> respondent and argued by the 
                    parties, the issue was: 
                    <b>
                        whether a petition filed into court and not signed by the 
                        petitioner herself can be said to be properly before the court and whether or not the 
                        court can entertain the petition or indeed allow an amendment
                    </b></p><p>
                    Mr. Lisimba contended before the learned trial Judge that it was a mandatory requirement 
                    that the petition is signed by the petitioner in person and not through her legal 
                    representative; that an adherence to the procedure provided by the Act was of the utmost 
                    importance.
                </p><p>
                    Counsel contended that the omission by the petitioner, in not signing the petition herself,
                    was so fatal that it rendered the petition dismissible in its current form for want of 
                    procedure; that any defect in the petition could only be corrected within 30 days, 
                    the period stipulated for bringing the petition to court.
                </p><p>
                    The record shows that Mr. Kamwi, counsel for the 1<span class="sup">st</span> respondent, 
                    did not submit before the learned trial Judge because he was constrained by the
                    application on account of what happened on their part during the elections. 
                    He, therefore, found it appropriate not to offer any position.
                </p><p>
                    In response to the submissions by counsel for the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> respondent, 
                    Mr. Simeza, counsel for the petitioner, submitted before the learned trial Judge that the 
                    issue that had arisen related to or rested on a proper construction of Section 96(3) of 
                    the Act.
                </p><p>
                    To that extent, counsel told the trial court that a petition was a pleading just like a statement 
                    of claim or defence. With reference to 
                    <ref id="ref13" type="bookCitation" href="/en/book/HalsburyLawsEngland/4/en@/main.xml#pag3-par1">
                        Halsbury's Laws of England. 4th Edition
                    </ref>, counsel submitted that where a pleading is settled by counsel it must 
                    be signed by him or her. He, therefore, contended that the petition before the trial court,
                    signed by the petitioner through her counsel, was properly signed as counsel did not have 
                    an existence or life independent of a client.
                </p><p><noteRef href="#not1" num="1"/><omissis>...</omissis></p></motivation><decision><p>
                     In summary, our position is that the appeal has no merit. We reiterate our finding that 
                     Section 96(3), as read with Section 2(1), makes it mandatory for the petitioner to sign 
                     the petition personally under her or his hand before presenting it to the High Court 
                     for trial and determination. 
                     As this was a novel appeal case on a matter of public interest, we shall make no order 
                     for costs. Each party to bear it own costs.
