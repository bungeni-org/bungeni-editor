                                The Constitution provides that Bills may be introduced in Parliament by a member of the 
                                Executive [only in the NA] or any member or committee of the House concerned 
                                <span class="sup"><noteRef href="#n2" num="1"/>1</span>.   
                                In practice, with a few exceptions, all Bills coming before Parliament emanate from the 
                                Executive.  Ordinary Bills [ie excluding Constitution amendment Bills and money Bills] 
                                normally go through the following stages:
                            </p><list id="cha1-sub1-par1-lis1"><item id="cha1-sub1-par1-lis1-ite1"><num>(1)</num><heading>Initiating, development and Cabinet approval</heading><p>
                                        The first stage involves initiating, developing and formal executive approval 
                                        of the draft legislation.  Usually a first draft is prepared by departmental 
                                        specialists, sometimes assisted by consultants, after consultation with 
                                        interested persons and institutions.  
                                        The draft is then submitted to Cabinet for approval in principle.
                                    </p></item><item id="cha1-sub1-par1-lis1-ite2"><num>(2)</num><heading>Submission of draft Bill to Parliament</heading><p>
                                        Joint Rule 159 requires that once Cabinet has approved the legislative proposals, 
                                        the draft of the proposed Bill must be sent to Parliament, 
                                        together with a memorandum explaining the objects of the proposed legislation.  
                                        The Speaker and the NCOP Chairperson must refer the draft to the responsible 
                                        committees of the respective Houses.  
                                        The purpose of this procedure is to assist the committees in planning their 
                                        work and to enable committee members to acquaint themselves with and to develop 
                                        their positions with regard to the proposed legislation.

                                                In practice this rule is not working as it should, with the result that its 
                                                purpose is lost.  Parliament often does not receive the Rule 159 draft 
                                                before the final Bill is submitted to Parliament for introduction.

                                                The purpose of Joint rule 159 is to make Parliament aware that proposed 
                                                legislation is coming; hence it is not necessary for the whole draft 
                                                Bill to be sent to Parliament at that stage – the long title or a

                                    Publication of the Bill itself in the Government Gazette could follow at a

                                 In terms of Joint Rule 220(1), a Bill introduced in either House has to be in 
                                 one of the official languages.  The Bill in that language will be the official 
                                 text for purposes of parliamentary proceedings.  In parliamentary proceedings 
                                 only the official text of a Bill is considered [Joint Rule 220(4)]. 
                                 A translation of the Bill into at least one of the other official languages has 
                                 to be in Parliament’s possession at least three days before the formal 
                                 consideration of the Bill by the House in which it was introduced 
                                 [Joint Rule 220(2)].  Such a translated version of a Bill is referred to as the 
                                 “official translation”.  The cover page of a Bill specifies which 
                                 language version of the Bill is the official text and which is an official 
                                 translation [Joint Rule 220(3)].  Since the adoption of Joint Rule 220 in 1999, 
                                 the official text of all Bills has been in English.  
                                 The language of the official translations of Bills has varied according to the 
                                 preferences of the introducers of the Bills.

                                Some countries have a legislation handbook which sets out the legislative process

                                the procedures to be followed in the different stages of making and amending laws.
                                The handbook has an official status and serves as a general guide in relation to

                                It is recommended that such a legislation handbook be developed as a joint

                                The handbook should set out the principles, processes and practices involved 
                                in making Acts of Parliament, from inception to completion.  
                                It should be a guide for everyone involved to better understand the
