               <from>The Speaker:</from>
               <p>Honourable members, I welcome you. However, I note that the number is smaller than yesterday's. I know there is a committee, which is busy in the Eastern part of Uganda, but others should be here. I do not know what is happening, even to the Front Bench. I do not know whether they have a meeting, but I have not been informed. Anyway, I welcome you.</p>
               <p>I will be adjusting the Order Paper to allow a statement from hon. Baba Diri and an informal question from hon. Banyenzaki. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that there is something which we as Parliament should take note of and find a solution to. The problem is the road carnage. There are very many deaths on our roads. I think something should be done to curb this because there was an accident in Mabira and another one on Masaka road. I think something has to be done. There must be something wrong. I am not supposed to participate in the debate, but I also own a constituency and I am a citizen who takes advantage of my seat here to point out what is going on. Something should be done.</p>

               <from>Mr Abdallah:</from>
               <p>Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the issues why the attendance is poor is that in most cases we begin plenary very late, yet you always adjourn this House to 2.00 p.m. Members are always here at 2.00 p.m. but we begin towards 3.00 p.m., so there is need to keep time.</p>

               <from>THE SPEAKER:</from>
               <p>That has no merit, I must say. You mean they went away because we did not start at 2.00 p.m.? When I am in my chambers I watch the attendance here.</p>

         <p>It is now time for the interruption of business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow, Wednesday, 11th May, at 9.00 a.m.</p>
