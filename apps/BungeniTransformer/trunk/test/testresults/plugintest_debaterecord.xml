               <from>THE SPEAKER</from>
               <p>Honourable members, I welcome you. However, I note that the number is smaller than yesterday’s. I know there is a committee, which is busy in the Eastern part of Uganda, but others should be here. I do not know what is happening, even to the Front Bench. I do not know whether they have a meeting, but I have not been informed. Anyway, I welcome you.</p>
               <p>I will be adjusting the Order Paper to allow a statement from hon. Baba Diri and an informal question from hon. Banyenzaki. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that there is something which we as Parliament should take note of and find a solution to. The problem is the road carnage. There are very many deaths on our roads. I think something should be done to curb this because there was an accident in Mabira and another one on Masaka road. I think something has to be done. There must be something wrong. I am not supposed to participate in the debate, but I also own a constituency and I am a citizen who takes advantage of my seat here to point out what is going on. Something should be done.</p>

            <from>MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA</from>
            <p>Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the issues why the attendance is poor is that in most cases we begin plenary very late, yet you always adjourn this House to 2.00 p.m. Members are always here at 2.00 p.m. but we begin towards 3.00 p.m., so there is need to keep time.</p>

               <from>The Member for Malava (Mr. Shitanda):</from>
               <p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to ask for a Ministerial Statement from the Minister for Local Government regarding his decision to ban matatus from accessing the Central Business District (CBD). This decision has left very many commuters inconvenienced, with some of them having to walk five kilometres to their places of work.</p>
               <p>Imagine a situation whereby a commuter from Eastlands is dropped at the City Stadium and his place of work is at Community! This commuter will walk a distance of almost five kilometres to reach his place of work. I would like to know from the Minister what he will do to ensure that his decision does not inconvenience commuters and whether that decision will, indeed, decongest the CBD. Why was his decision selective in the sense that there are some public service vehicles which have been allowed to access the CBD? I would wish him to explain his decision to this House.</p>
