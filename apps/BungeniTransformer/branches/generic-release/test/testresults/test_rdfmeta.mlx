      <block name="p" id="d7e164" class="Standard">Honourable members, I welcome you. However, I note that the number is smaller than yesterday's. I know there is a committee, which is busy in the Eastern part of Uganda, but others should be here. I do not know what is happening, even to the Front Bench. I do not know whether they have a meeting, but I have not been informed. Anyway, I welcome you.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e169" class="Standard">I will be adjusting the Order Paper to allow a statement from hon. Baba Diri and an informal question from hon. Banyenzaki. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that there is something which we as Parliament should take note of and find a solution to. The problem is the road carnage. There are very many deaths on our roads. I think something should be done to curb this because there was an accident in Mabira and another one on Masaka road. I think something has to be done. There must be something wrong. I am not supposed to participate in the debate, but I also own a constituency and I am a citizen who takes advantage of my seat here to point out what is going on. Something should be done.</block>

      <block name="p" id="d7e178" class="Standard">Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the issues why the attendance is poor is that in most cases we begin plenary very late, yet you always adjourn this House to 2.00 p.m. Members are always here at 2.00 p.m. but we begin towards 3.00 p.m., so there is need to keep time.</block>

      <block name="p" id="d7e214" class="P1">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to ask for a Ministerial Statement from the Minister for Local Government regarding his decision to ban matatus from accessing the Central Business District (CBD). This decision has left very many commuters inconvenienced, with some of them having to walk five kilometres to their places of work.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e217" class="Standard">Imagine a situation whereby a commuter from Eastlands is dropped at the City Stadium and his place of work is at Community! This commuter will walk a distance of almost five kilometres to reach his place of work. I would like to know from the Minister what he will do to ensure that his decision does not inconvenience commuters and whether that decision will, indeed, decongest the CBD. Why was his decision selective in the sense that there are some public service vehicles which have been allowed to access the CBD? I would wish him to explain his decision to this House.</block>

      <block name="p" id="d7e322" class="Standard">Bitumenization of Arabia Airstrip</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e327" class="Standard">Mr. Aden asked the Minister for Transport and Communication -</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e330" class="Standard">(a)why the Ministry has abandoned the work of bituminizing the Arabia Airstrip after having done the project half-way in 1978; and</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e334" class="Standard">(b)when this work will be completed.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e339" class="Standard">The Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications (Dr. Momanyi):</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e342" class="Standard">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e345" class="Standard">(a) The Arabia Airstrip is of gravel surface, and that is how it was intended to be. At no time has any bitumen work ever been undertaken in 1978 and stopped, as the question implies. The airstrip was last graded in June, 1988.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e348" class="Standard">(b) According to the Ministry's current Development Plan there is no provision to bituminize Arabia Airstrip.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e354" class="Standard">Mr. Aden:</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e357" class="Standard">Arising from the reply given by the Assistant Minister, is he denying the fact that the Mandera District Development Committee (D.D.C.) recommended bituminization of this particular airstrip way back in 1977? What did the Ministry do about that recommendation of the D.D.C.?</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e362" class="Standard">Dr. Momanyi:</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e365" class="Standard">Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not always that the Minisry goes by the recommendations of the D.D.C. This is because to build an airstrip, you must look at various things. I want to inform the House now that there is no sufficient volume of traffic for the Arabia Airstrip. Already, in Mandera District, we have bituminized airstrips at El Wak, El Rhamu and Mandera.</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e371" class="Standard">Mr. Aden:</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e374" class="Standard">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am amazed by the reply given by the Assistant Minister. It is the people who live in the area who know what the airstrip is like. Now the basis of development is the recommendation of the D.D.C. Now that the Assistant Minister says that they abide by the recommendations of the D.D.C., does he imply that his Ministry is better placed to know about the place than the inhabitants of Arabia?</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e379" class="Standard">Dr. Momanyi:</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e382" class="Standard">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said it is not always that the Ministry goes by the recommendations of the D.D.C. Hon. Aden should have understood that. However, let me now give the statistical figures which come form the Directorate of Civil Aviation (D.C.A.).</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e386" class="Standard">(...)</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e391" class="Standard">Mr. Aden:</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e394" class="Standard">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not know how the Assistant Minister wants an airstrip that is unfinished to be used by an aircraft. Is he aware that various officials who fly out of Nairobi, and who want to visit particular projects in that division, land at Mandera Airstrip, which is 35 miles away and then drive by road because there is no serviceable landing airstrip?</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e399" class="Standard">Dr. Momanyi:</block>
      <block name="p" id="d7e403" class="Standard">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the airstrip has been maintained regularly. It was last graded in 1988. I would like to inform the hon. Member that gravel surface, if it has a strong foundation and is well-maintained, can be used by aircraft of a certain weight.</block>
