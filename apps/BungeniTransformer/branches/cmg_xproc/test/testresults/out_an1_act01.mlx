              <div> CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS </div>
              <div>   </div>
              <div> General Rules </div>
              <p> 1. Wording of will. It is not necessary, in order to give effect
                to any disposition, that any technical words be used in a will, but only that the
                wording be such that the intention of the testator can be known
                therefrom. 2. Meaning of clause to be collected from entire
                will. The meaning of any clause in a will is to be ascertained from the
                entire instrument, and all the provisions of the will are to be construed with
                reference to each other; but where two clauses or provisions are irreconcilable, so
                that they cannot possibly stand together, the last shall
                prevail. 3. Will speaks from death as to property comprised in
                it. Every will shall be construed, with reference to the property
                comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately
                before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears by the
                will; Provided that, in respect of the subject of a specific
                legacy, there shall be a presumption that the will speaks as at the date of its
                actual execution. 4. Negative words insufficient to exclude
                person entitled on intestacy. Merely negative words in a will shall not
                be sufficient to exclude a person entitled on intestacy and in order to effect such
                an exclusion there must be an actual gift to some other definite
                object. 5. Express gift cannot be controlled by reason
                assigned, etc. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, an express and
                positive gift cannot be controlled by reason assigned, or by subsequent ambiguous
                words, or by inference and argument from other parts of the will, and is not
                affected by a subsequent inaccurate recital of, or reference to, its
                contents: Provided that, in cases of ambiguity or doubt,
                recourse may be had to such reference in order to assist the
                construction. 6. Implication admissible only in absence of
                express disposition. Implication shall be admissible only in the absence
                of an express disposition, and shall not be admissible to control an express
                disposition. 7. Words may be supplied, rejected,
                etc. Words and limitations contained in a will may be transposed,
                supplied or rejected, where such a course is warranted by the immediate context or
                the general scheme of the will, but not merely on a conjectural hypothesis of the
                testator’s intention, and obvious clerical errors may be
                corrected. 8. Technical words. Technical words
                shall be presumed to be employed in their technical sense, unless the context
                clearly indicates the contrary. 9. Words in
                general. Words in general shall be construed in their ordinary and
                grammatical sense, unless a clear intention to use them in another sense can be
                collected from the will and that other sense can be ascertained.
                 10. Words occurring more than once. Words
                occurring more than once in a will shall be presumed to be used always in the same
                sense unless the context clearly indicates the contrary or unless the words are
                applied to different subjects. 11. Additional
                words. Where a testator uses an additional word or phrase, an additional
                meaning shall be presumed unless the context clearly indicates the
                contrary. 12. Words construed so as to make them
                operative. When a clause or disposition is capable of two meanings,
                according to one of which it has some effect, and according to the other of which it
                can have no effect, the former shall be preferred. 13.
                Intention to be given effect to. Where for any reason effect cannot be
                given completely to the testator’s apparent intention, effect shall nevertheless be
                given thereto so far as is possible. 14. Rules of construction
                not to be strained to validate gift. The rules of construction shall not
                be strained in order to bring a gift within the rules of law, but, where the will
                admits of two constructions, the construction which will render the gift valid shall
                be preferred: Provided that where a gift, valid in the first
                instance, is modified by some subsequent clause in the same will or in a codicil
                thereto in such manner as to render the preceding gift void for remoteness, the
                modifying clause, if separable from the original gift, shall be rejected as if the
                will or codicil had never contained it. 15. Inconvenience or
                absurdity of gift. The inconvenience or absurdity of a gift, or the fact
                that the testator did not foresee all the consequences of his disposition, shall not
                be a ground for varying the construction of the will where the terms are
                unambiguous; but, where the terms of any gift or disposition are ambiguous, the more
                rational of two constructions shall be preferred. 16.
                Construction not to be varied by subsequent events. The construction of a
                will shall not be varied by events subsequent to its execution, but in determining
                the meaning of particular expressions regard may be had to circumstances which, at
                the date of execution, were capable of arising subsequent to that
                date. 17. Presumption against intestacy. A testator
                shall be presumed to calculate against intestacy; and, subject to the provisions of
                paragraph 14, a construction avoiding intestacy shall be
                preferred. 18. Presumption as regards gift over. A
                testator shall be presumed to calculate on the dispositions in his will taking
                effect; and a gift over shall not, in the absence of clear intention, be construed
                as providing exclusively for lapse or other initial failure of the original
                gift. 19. Independent gifts. Unless a design to
                connect them appears from the will, independent gifts shall be construed separately
                and without relation to one another, notwithstanding that it may be conjectured from
                the circumstances that the testator had the same intention with regards to all such
                gifts. 20. References to child, etc., to include illegitimate
                child, etc. Unless a contrary intention appears from the will, the terms
                “child”, “son”, “daughter”, “grandchild”, and “issue” and similar words shall be
                construed in accordance with the definition of “child” in subsection (2) and with
                the provisions of subsection (3) of section 3 of this Act. 21.
                References to application of Islamic law to mean law of sect or school of
                testator. Unless a contrary intention appears from the will, where a
                testator declares that his property shall devolve according to Islamic law, the
                Islamic law applicable shall be the law of the sect or school of Islamic law to
                which the deceased belonged. 22. Particular rules of
                construction. The several particular rules of construction provided by
                the following paragraphs shall apply if, and so far only, as a contrary intention is
                not expressed or implied in the will, and shall have effect subject to the terms of
                the will.</p>
              <div> Descriptions </div>
              <p> 23. Misnomer or misdescription of object. (1) Where the words
                used in a will to designate or describe a legatee, or a class of legatees,
                sufficiently show what is meant, an error in the name of description shall not
                prevent the legacy from taking effect, and it shall be sufficient for this purpose
                if the legatee, or class of legatees, is so designated as to be distinguished from
                every other person or class.  (2) A mistake in the name of a
                legatee may be corrected by a description of that legatee and a mistake in the
                description of a legatee may be corrected by the name of that
                legatee. (3) Where the words used in a will to designate or
                describe a legatee are applicable to two or more persons or classes of persons, or
                partly to one and partly to another person or class, the legatee or class of
                legatees may be ascertained from the general context and the surrounding
                circumstances. 24. Rejection of erroneous particulars in
                description of subjects. If the thing which the testator intended to
                bequeath can be sufficiently identified from the description of it given in the
                will, but some parts of the description do not apply, such parts of the description
                shall be rejected as erroneous, and the gift shall take
                effect: Provided that, if a will mentions several
                circumstances as descriptive of the thing which the testator intends to bequeath,
                and there was any property in respect of which all those circumstances existed at
                the date of execution of the will, the gift shall be considered as limited to that
                property, and no part of the description shall be rejected as erroneous because the
                testator had at the date of his death other property to which that part of the
                description does not apply. 25. Gift or disposition void for
                uncertainty. A gift or disposition not expressive of any definite
                intention shall be void for uncertainty: Provided
                that- (i) no gift for charitable purposes shall be void for
                uncertainty of the object; or (ii) no gift whereby the legatee
                is expressly or impliedly given a right of selection, purchase or disposition shall
                be void merely by reason of the uncertainty arising from that
                right. 26. Gift presumed to comprise whole interest of
                testator. Where property is bequeathed to any person, the gift shall be
                presumed to comprise the whole interest of the testator in that property, unless it
                appears from the will that only a restricted interest was intended for
                him. 27. Construction of bequest which refers to person as
                existing. The object of a gift which refers to a person or persons as
                existing shall be construed as at the date of the will, unless a contrary intention
                clearly appears therein.</p>
              <div> Residuary Bequests </div>
              <p> 28. Effect of general residuary bequest. A general residuary
                bequest shall comprise all free property of the testator as at the date of his
                death, whether or not acquired after the date of the will, of which he has not
                otherwise disposed, and shall include all free property of which he may have
                attempted but failed to dispose, even though expressly excepted from the
                gift. 29. Effect of limited residuary bequest. A
                limited residuary bequest shall have the same effect as a general residuary bequest,
                subject only to the specific limitation therein expressed or
                implied. 30. Effect of particular residuary
                bequest. A particular residuary bequest shall comprise all free property
                of the testator falling under the particular description as at the date of his
                death, of which he has not otherwise disposed, and shall include all such property
                of which he may have attempted but failed to dispose. 31.
                Effect of failure of share of residue. The failure of any gift of a share
                in a residuary bequest, whether general, limited or particular, shall not result in
                that share accruing to the other shares therein, but, subject only to any subsequent
                residuary bequest, shall create an intestacy in respect of that share.</p>
              <div> General Legacy of Property not Possessed </div>
              <p> 32. General legacy of property not in testator’s possession.
                Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 8 to 14 of the Second Schedule, where a
                general legacy is in the form of a gift of a specified type of property which is not
                at the time of the testator’s death included in his estate, the value of that gift
                shall, if it can be ascertained, be met from the testator’s general estate, but if
                the value thereof cannot be ascertained the gift shall fail.</p>
              <div> Annuities </div>
              <p> 33. Annuity created by will payable for life only, unless contrary intention
                appears by will. Where an annuity is created by will, the legatee shall
                be entitled to receive it for his life only, unless a contrary intention appears by
                the will, notwithstanding that the annuity is directed to be paid out of the income
                of a specified fund or specified property. 34. Annuities for
                maintenance and education. Where there is the gift of an annuity for the
                maintenance and education of the beneficiary, that annuity shall be deemed to be
                given for the life of the beneficiary. 35. Where will directs
                that annuity be provided out of property or where money bequeathed to be invested in
                purchase of annuity. Where a will directs that an annuity shall be
                provided for any person out of the proceeds of property generally, or where money is
                bequeathed to be invested in the purchase of an annuity for any person, the legatee
                may either have an annuity purchased for him or receive forthwith the money
                appropriated for that purpose by the will.  36. Relation of
                annuity to residuary estate. (1) Where there is a direct gift of an
                annuity, or where a will manifests an intention that an annuity shall be charged on
                the capital of the testator’s residuary estate, the annuity shall constitute a
                charge upon that capital. (2) In all other cases, in default
                of specific provision, the annuity shall be payable only out of the income of the
                residuary estate. (3) In default of provision to the contrary,
                an annuity payable only out of the income of the residuary estate, or of a specified
                fund or of specified property, shall constitute, together with all arrears thereof,
                a continuing charge on the whole of the income. 37.
                Commencement of annuity and time for payment when no time fixed by will.
                When an annuity is given by will, and no time is fixed for its commencement, it
                shall commence from the testator’s death, and the first payment shall be made at the
                expiration of one year after that event: Provided that, where
                there is a direction that the annuity shall be paid quarterly or monthly, the first
                payment shall be due at the end of the quarter or month, as the case may be,
                immediately after the testator’s death; and shall, if the personal representatives
                think fit, be paid when due but the personal representatives shall not be bound to
                pay it until the expiry of twelve months after the testator’s
                death. 38. Dates of successive payments directed to be made
                within given time or on day certain.  Where there is a direction that the
                first payment of an annuity shall be made within any specified period of time after
                the death of the testator, or on a day certain, the next payment to be made, and
                subsequent payments, shall be made accordingly. 39.
                Apportionment. If an annuitant dies in the interval between the times for
                payment of his annuity, an apportioned share of the annuity shall be paid to his
                personal representatives.</p>
              <div> Gifts of Income </div>
              <div>   </div>
              <div> 40. Gift of income for indefinite period. </div>
              <div> Where the income of any fund, property or residuary estate is bequeathed
                to any person, and the will affords no indication of an intention that the enjoyment
                of the gift should be of limited duration, the principal, as well as the income,
                shall belong to the legatee. </div>
              <div>   </div>
              <div> Gifts for Special Purposes </div>
              <p> 41. Effect of gift for special purpose. Where a gift is
                bequeathed solely for the benefit of the legatee, then, notwithstanding that words
                are added to the gift expressing a purpose for which the gift is made, the legatee
                shall be entitled to claim the gift without applying it to that purpose, whether or
                not the purpose be expressed in obligatory terms: Provided
                that- (i) where the gift is made subject to a gift over of any surplus
                remaining after the purpose has been fulfilled, the provisions of this paragraph
                shall apply only to so much of the gift as is necessary for that
                purpose; (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply
                where the purpose specified is so expressed as to create a condition or a
                discretionary trust with gift over, nor where the legatee is a
                minor. 42. Effect of discretion as to time. Where a
                gift of a sum of money is directed to be applied solely for the benefit of a person
                in a certain way, but the time within which the gift is to be expended is left in
                the discretion of the personal representatives or of trustees, the beneficiary shall
                not, so long as the personal representatives or the trustees properly exercise their
                discretion, demand payment of the money, but if he dies before the money is so
                applied, his personal representatives shall be immediately entitled to the
                money.</p>
              <div> Conditional Gifts </div>
              <p> 43. Express words unnecessary. No precise form of words shall be
                necessary to create a condition in a will, and any expression disclosing such an
                intention of the testator shall have that effect. 44. Void
                conditions. Any condition shall be void which- (a)
                requires the performance of an illegal act, or is not legally enforceable;
                or (b) is contrary to law, morality or public policy;
                or (c) is uncertain, or is too vague to be enforced;
                or (d) offends against any law as to accumulations,
                remoteness, or perpetuities; or (e) is impossible ab initio,
                or becomes impossible by the act or default of the testator, or by an act of any
                court; or (f) is repugnant to the gift to which it is annexed;
                or (g) is in total restraint of the marriage of any person
                other than a widow; or (h) is attached to a gift of capital to
                a widow, in total restraint of her marriage, without providing for any gift over on
                default; or (i) forbids dispute of the will, without providing
                for any gift over on default; or (j) restrains alienation,
                voluntary or involuntary, of the subject of the gift: Provided
                that nothing in this subparagraph shall affect or render void any discretionary
                trust with gift over, or any life estate made determinable on
                bankruptcy. 45. Condition either precedent or
                subsequent. (1) A condition shall be either precedent, in that the
                performance thereof is made to precede the vesting of a gift in interest, or
                subsequent, in that the non-performance thereof is made to determine a gift
                antecedently vested in interest. (2) In case of doubt,
                construction of a condition as a condition subsequent shall be preferred to
                construction as a condition precedent. 46. Effect of void
                condition. (1) Where a gift is made upon a condition subsequent which is
                void, the gift shall be absolute. (2) Where a gift is made
                upon a condition precedent which is void, the gift shall be void
                if- (a) the void condition is the sole motive of the bequest;
                or (b) the impossible nature of the condition was unknown to
                the testator; or (c) the condition is illegal as involving the
                performance of an unlawful act, but in all other cases the gift shall be
                absolute. 47. Effect of impossibility supervening.
                (1) Where a gift is made upon a condition subsequent which was valid ab initio, but
                which has, for any reason, become impossible before being performed, the gift shall
                be absolute. (2) Where a gift is made upon a condition
                precedent which was valid ab initio, but which has, for any reason other that the
                act or default of the testator or an act of any court, become impossible before
                being performed, the gift shall be void. 48. Legatee bound by
                legal conditions. Where a legatee has taken a gift subject to a valid
                condition, he shall be estopped by his act of taking the gift from subsequently
                insisting on rights which, by the terms of the conditions, he is bound to release,
                or from declining a duty which he is required by the condition to
                perform. 49. One or two separate and independent bequests to
                same person may be accepted and the other refused. Where a will contains
                two separate and independent gifts to the same person, the legatee may take one of
                them, and may refuse the other, although either or both of the gifts was made upon
                condition. 50. Time in which conditions must be
                performed. Where a gift is made upon a condition, and no time is
                specified for its performance, the legatee shall perform the condition within a
                reasonable time: Provided that- (i)
                where the condition is for the benefit of another person, then, in the absence of
                any specified time in which the condition is to be performed, the legatee shall
                perform the condition upon demand being made by that other
                person; (ii) where the condition is the happening of a
                specified uncertain event beyond the control of the legatee, the gift shall take
                effect if that event happens before the gift is payable or distributable, but not
                thereafter. 51. Performance generally. The
                performance of a condition shall be such as to constitute a substantial compliance
                with the terms of the condition: Provided that, in respect of
                time, there shall be strict compliance where there is any express gift
                over. 52. Ignorance of condition. Where a gift is
                made upon a valid condition, ignorance of that condition shall not protect the
                legatee from the consequences of his default, unless ignorance is attributable to
                the act of default of some person who benefits by breach of that
                condition.</p>
              <div> Gifts to Executors </div>
              <p> 53. Legatee named as executor cannot take unless he shows intention to act
                as executor. If a gift is bequeathed to a person who is named an executor
                of the will for his own benefit, and is not given independently of the office of the
                executor, there shall be a presumption that he is not intended to take the gift
                unless he proves the will or otherwise unequivocally manifests an intention to act
                as executor.</p>
              <div> Vesting and Divesting of Gifts </div>
              <p> 54. Meaning and effect of vesting. (1) A gift shall vest in the
                legatee in interest when his entitlement to the gift, whether in possession or
                reversion, or to be enjoyed in possession at some future time, becomes
                certain. (2) Where the legatee dies before receiving
                possession of a gift already vested in him in interest, that gift, unless divested
                by his death, shall pass to his personal representative. (3)
                Where the legatee dies before a gift vests in him in interest, the gift shall have
                no effect: Provided that a gift over which is contingent only
                upon a collateral event, irrespective of the legatee attaining a specified age or
                surviving a specified period, shall vest in the personal representatives of the
                legatee if that event happens after his death. 55. Direction
                for vesting. A direction that a gift shall vest at any given time shall,
                unless it appears from the will to refer to vesting in possession, be construed as
                referring to vesting in interest. 56. Time of vesting of
                general terms. If a gift be made in general terms, without specifying any
                particular time for the vesting thereof, the legatee shall have a vested interest
                therein from the day of the death of the testator, or so soon thereafter as he comes
                into existence or the terms of the gift may otherwise permit.
                57. Vesting of contingent gifts. If a gift be made in terms which clearly
                indicate that the interest of the legatee shall be contingent upon the happening of
                some uncertain event (other than the performance of a void condition not itself
                avoiding the gift), the interest shall not vest in the legatee until the event has
                happened. 58. Gift may vest subject to subsequent
                divesting. A gift may be made to vest immediately on the testator’s death
                or on the happening of a specified event, notwithstanding that, by the terms of the
                will, it is subject to subsequent divesting on the happening or not happening of
                some uncertain event. 59. Absolute gift with enjoyment
                postponed. Where a substantive gift is made subject only to a direction
                that it shall not be paid or delivered to the legatee until the happening of some
                future event, the legatee shall acquire an immediate vested interest, although
                vesting in possession shall be postponed in accordance with the
                direction: Provided that a mere direction that the legatee
                attains an age exceeding full age shall be inoperative after he attains full
                age. 60. Direction for payment without substantive
                gift. Where the gift consists solely in a direction to pay or distribute
                at a future age, or upon the happening of some future event (other than performance
                of a void condition not itself avoiding the gift) without any substantive gift, the
                gift shall not vest in interest until that future age is attained or that future
                event occurs: Provided that when the payment or distribution
                appears to be postponed merely for the convenience of the fund or the property, as
                the case may be, the vesting shall not be deferred as provided in this
                paragraph. 61. Gift subject to attaining certain age or
                marrying. Where a gift is made to a legatee and the attainment of a
                certain age or marriage is introduced into and made a constituent part of the
                description or character of the legatee, the vesting of the gift in interest shall
                be postponed until the attainment of that age or marriage, as the case may
                be. 62. Effect of interim direction for
                maintenance. Where, under the terms of any gift, the vesting thereof
                purports to be postponed to a given age and the gift is accompanied by a direction
                that the intermediate income shall be applied for the maintenance of the legatee,
                the gift shall vest in interest immediately, whether or not he attains that
                age: Provided that this rule shall not apply to the gift of an
                entire fund to be distributed among a class of persons equally on attaining a given
                age. 63. Ambiguity of vesting contingency or
                divesting Where the terms of a will are ambiguous in respect of the
                vesting, contingency or divesting of a gift, it shall, subject to all other rules of
                construction, be so construed as to give the legatee a vested rather than a
                contingent interest.</p>
              <div> Satisfaction </div>
              <p> 64. Presumed satisfaction of debt. Where a debtor bequeaths a
                gift to his creditor, and the gift is equal to or greater than the debt, there shall
                be a presumption that the gift is intended to satisfy the debt, and not to be taken
                in addition to payment of the debt:  Provided that this
                presumption shall arise only in respect of a debt contracted before the date of
                execution of the will. 65. Presumed satisfaction of
                portion. Where a person who is under an obligation by contract to provide
                a portion for his child, or for some other person to whom he stands in loco
                parentis, fails to do so, but makes a gift to that child or other person by will,
                there shall be a presumption that the gift is intended to satisfy that portion, so
                far as the gift extends. 66. No presumed satisfaction of gift
                made previously in contemplation of death. A gift made by will shall not
                of itself raise any presumption that the gift is intended to satisfy or to take the
                place of a gift, whether or not of equal amount, previously made to the same person
                by the testator in contemplation of death.</p>
              <div> Additional and Substituted Gifts </div>
              <p> 67. Two gifts to same person. Where a testator has purported to
                make two gifts to the same person, and a question arises whether he intended to make
                the second gift instead of or in addition to the first, and if there is nothing in
                the will or wills to show what he intended, the following rules shall have effect in
                determining the construction to be put upon the will or wills-
                (a) if the same specific thing is bequeathed twice to the same legatee by the same
                will, or by separate wills, he shall be entitled to receive that specific thing
                only; (b) where one and the same will purports to make, in two
                places, a gift to the same person of the same quantity or amount of anything, he
                shall be entitled to one of those gifts only; (c) where two
                gifts of unequal amount are given to the same person by the same will, the legatee
                shall be entitled to both gifts; (d) where two gifts, whether
                equal or unequal in amount, are given to the same legatee by separate wills, the
                legatee shall be entitled to both gifts.</p>
              <div> Liabilities Incidental to Gifts </div>
              <p> 68. Liability for charges. (1) Where the free property of a
                deceased person includes an interest in property which at the time of his death is
                charged with the payment of money, whether by way of mortgage, charge, lien
                (including a lien for unpaid purchase money), pledge or otherwise, and the deceased
                has not by will, deed or other document signified a contrary or other intention, the
                interest so charged shall, as between the different persons claiming through the
                deceased, be primarily liable for the payment and every part of the interest,
                according to its value, shall bear a proportionate part of the
                payment. (2) Any contrary or other intention shall not be
                deemed to be signified by a general direction for payment of debts out of any
                residuary estate, or by a charge of debts upon any residuary estate, unless the
                intention is further signified by words expressly or by necessary implication
                referring to the payment so charged. (3) A periodical payment
                in the nature of land revenue or in the nature of rent in respect of any period
                prior to the death of the testator is not a payment contemplated by this
                rule. 69. Completion of testator’s title to things bequeathed
                to be at cost of his estate. Where anything is to be done to complete the
                testator’s title to the thing bequeathed, other than a payment with which that thing
                is charged at the date of his death, it shall be done at the cost of his
                estate. 70. Exoneration of legatee’s immovable property for
                which land revenue or rent payable periodically. Where there is a gift of
                any interest in immovable property, in respect of which payment in the nature of
                land revenue or in the nature of rent has to be made periodically, the estate of the
                testator shall (as between the estate and the legatee) make good the payments or a
                proportion of them, as the case may be, up to the day of his
                death. 71. Exoneration of specific legatee’s
                securities. In the absence of any direction in the will, any call or
                other payment due from the testator at the time of his death in respect of any
                securities, of which there is a specific legacy, if it is not then charged upon
                those securities by way of lien or otherwise, shall, as between the testator’s
                estate and the legatee, be borne by the estate, but if any call or other payment
                becomes due in respect of those securities after the testator’s death, it shall, as
                between the testator’s estate and the legatee, be borne by the legatee, if he
                accepts the gift. 72. Order of payment when legacy directed to
                be paid out of fund the subject of specific legacy. Where a portion of a
                fund is specifically bequeathed and a legacy is directed to be paid out of the same
                fund, the portion specifically bequeathed shall first be paid to the legatee
                thereof, and the demonstrative legacy shall be paid out of the residue of the fund,
                and, so far as the residue shall be deficient, out of the general assets of the
                testator, in exoneration of the specific legacy. 73. Expenses
                to be borne by legatee. The costs of preservation, transfer or delivery
                of the subject of a specific legacy shall be borne by the legatee.</p>
              <div> Gifts to Survivors </div>
              <p> 74. Gifts to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period
                not specified. (1) Where a gift is in effect made to such of certain
                persons as shall be surviving at some period, but the exact period is not specified,
                it shall go to such of them as shall be alive at the time of payment or distribution
                and capable of taking. (2) The provisions of this paragraph
                shall apply whether the gift is to vest in possession immediately on the death of
                the testator, or at some time subsequent thereto upon the termination of a prior
                interest: Provided that, where the time of payment of
                distribution depends upon the happening of two events, one of which is personal, and
                the other of which is not personal, to the legatee, the gift shall, subject to all
                other rules of construction, be construed as referring to the happening of the
                former event exclusively.</p>
              <div> Exercise of Powers </div>
              <p> 75. Execution of power of appointment by general legacy or residuary
                bequest. Unless a contrary intention is clearly expressed or implied in
                the will- (a) a general legacy or limited residuary bequest
                shall be construed to include any property falling within the general description of
                that legacy or bequest over which the testator may have a general power of
                appointment by will and shall operate as an execution of that power as regards that
                property; and (b) a general residuary bequest shall be
                construed to include any property over which the testator may have a general power
                of appointment by will and shall operate as an execution of that
                power: Provided that, unless an intention in that behalf is
                clearly expressed or implied in the will, no such gift shall in either event be
                construed as an exercise of any power of revocation and new
                appointment. 76. Execution of special powers. No
                general legacy or general residuary bequest shall be construed as an execution of
                any special power of appointment unless an intention in that behalf is clearly
                expressed or implied in the will. 77. Particular residuary
                bequests. No particular residuary bequest shall be construed as an
                execution of any general or special power of appointment unless an intention in that
                behalf is clearly expressed or implied in the will. 78.
                Implied gifts to objects of special power in default of appointment.
                Where by a will any special power of appointment is given over property, but no
                provision is made in the event of default of appointment, the property shall, in
                default of any such appointment or so far as it may not extend, belong to all the
                objects of the power in equal shares, subject to all appointments made thereunder
                being brought into account.</p>

              <p> (s.23)</p>
              <p> FAILURE OF TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITIONS<em>By
                  Lapse</em></p>
              <p><b>1.</b> Principle of lapse. (1) Save as is
                provided in this Schedule no gift or disposition shall confer any benefit on any
                person who predeceases the testator, and where a gift or disposition fails on this
                account it is said to “lapse”. (2) Subject to the provisions
                of section 43 of this Act, the burden of proving that a legatee or appointee under a
                will has survived the testator shall lie upon the person alleging survivorship.
                 (3) A statement in a will that there shall be no lapse shall
                have no effect, except and so far as a further legatee or appointee, capable of
                taking, is designated. <b>2.
                </b>Exceptions. (1) Unless a contrary intention appears in the
                will, there shall be no lapse in either of the following cases -
                 (a) where the gift or disposition is made in discharge of a
                moral obligation recognized by the testator; or (b) where the
                gift or disposition is in favour of any child or other issue of the testator, for
                any estate or interest not determinable at or before the death of the child or other
                issue and the child or other issue, as the case may be, leaves issue surviving the
                testator, but in either case the gift or disposition shall take effect as if the
                deceased legatee had died immediately after the testator. (2)
                Where a gift or disposition is in favour of a described class of persons,
                notwithstanding that one or more of the class is named, and any member of that class
                survives to take a vested interest, there shall be no lapse but the survivor or
                survivors shall take the whole: Provided that, if property is
                bequeathed to a class of persons described as standing in a particular degree of
                kindred to a specified individual, but the vesting of their interest is deferred
                until a time later than the death of the testator, by reason of a prior bequest or
                otherwise, the property shall at that time go to such of them capable of taking as
                are then alive and to the personal representatives of any of them otherwise capable
                of taking who have died since the death of the
                  testator.<b>3. </b>Gift to several
                named persons. Where there is a gift or disposition to several named
                persons, who do not constitute a class for the purpose of the will, and one or more
                of those persons predecease the testator, then -  (a) if an
                intention appears from the will that those persons should take as joint tenants, or
                that only the survivors of them should take, there shall be no lapse, if any of them
                survives the testator and is capable of taking the whole; but
                (b) if an intention appears from the will that those persons should take as tenants
                in common, and no intention appears therefrom that only the survivors of them should
                take, there shall be a lapse in respect of the share or shares of any of those
                persons predeceasing the testator, subject only to the provisions of paragraph
                  2.<b>4.</b> Charges of gifts on gifts.
                 Where one gift is charged on the subject of another gift -
                 (a) if the encumbered gift lapses, the charge shall continue
                to have effect notwithstanding the lapse; (b) if the
                encumbering gift lapses, the legatee of the encumbered gift shall take the whole
                subject thereof free of the charge, unless a contrary intention is expressed or
                implied in the will.<b>5. </b>Lapse of
                limited interests.  The lapse of a limited interest shall accelerate the
                interests in remainder expectant on the determination of the limited
                  interest.<b>6. </b>Effect on gifts
                over.  Where a gift or disposition is made to one person with a gift over
                to another person in such circumstances that the gift over would fail if the
                original legatee survived the testator, the lapse of the original gift or
                disposition shall result in the gift over taking
                  effect.<b>7.</b> General effect of
                lapse.  Subject only to the foregoing provisions of this Schedule, if a
                gift or disposition lapses, the property or interest in the subject thereof shall
                pass under any residuary bequest which, but for the gift or disposition, would have
                applied to the property or interest: Provided that, if there is no such
                residuary bequest, or if the lapsed gift or disposition is itself a share of the
                residuary bequest and there is no ulterior residuary bequest under which it can
                pass, then there shall be intestacy in respect of the property or
                interest.</p>
              <p>
                <em>By Ademption</em>
              </p>
              <p><b>8. </b>Principal of ademption.  (1) If
                property which has been specifically bequeathed does not belong to the testator at
                the time of his death, or has been converted into property of a different kind, the
                gift cannot take effect by reason of the subject thereof having been withdrawn from
                the operation of the will; and where a gift fails on this account it is said to be
                "adeemed". (2) There must be a substantial change in the
                subject of a specific legacy to cause ademption and a merely nominal change shall
                not have that effect.<b>9. </b>Change of
                subject without testator's consent.  Where property specifically
                bequeathed undergoes a change between the date of the will and the testator's death,
                and the change is caused by a wrongful conversion, the gift shall not be adeemed,
                but where the change is caused by the authority of any written law, whether or not
                approved by the testator, there shall be ademption unless the written law effecting
                the conversion provides otherwise.<b>10.
                </b>Gift of interest in fund.  The gift of an interest in a
                fund shall not be adeemed by any sale or change of investment of the find by the
                persons having control thereof, nor shall it be adeemed by the testator receiving it
                before his death, whether or not thereafter sold or reinvested by him, if it can at
                his death be followed and distinguished.<b>11.
                </b>Non-ademption of demonstrative legacy.  A demonstrative
                legacy shall not be adeemed by reason that the property on which it is charged by
                the will does not exist at the time of the death of the testator, or has been
                converted into property of a different kind, but it shall, in that case, be paid out
                of the general estate of the testator.<b>12.
                </b>Revival of will does not revive adeemed legacy.  The
                revival of a will shall not revive an adeemed gift, so as to give the legatee any
                interest in any property then representing the original subject of the adeemed
                  gift.<b>13. </b>No presumption of
                intention. Apart from any intention which may be expressed or implied in
                the terms of the will itself, there shall be no presumption of intention that
                ademption shall or shall not in any particular circumstances
                result: Provided that the intention of the testator, to be
                ascertained according to the ordinary rules of construction, shall always be
                relevant to determine the precise subject of the
                  gift.<b>14. </b>Ademption by
                subsequent provision.  Where a testator makes a gift by will to any
                person for a specific purpose, or to any child or other person to whom he stands in
                  <em>loco parentis</em> by way of portion, and after the date of
                execution of that will provides by deed of settlement or otherwise for the same
                purpose or by way of portion for the same child or other person, there shall be a
                presumption that the gift is adeemed by the subsequent provision, so far as the
                subsequent provision extends.</p>

              <p> ELECTION</p>
              <p><b>1.</b> Principle of election. (1) Where a
                person, by a will validly made in accordance with Part II of this Act, purports to
                dispose of any property which is not his own, and bequeaths a gift to the person to
                whom that property belongs, the legatee accepting the gift so bequeathed to him may
                elect to give effect to the testator’s attempted disposition or to enforce his
                proprietary rights against that disposition. (2) If a legatee
                elects under this paragraph to enforce proprietary rights, he shall make
                compensation, out of the gift bequeathed to him, to the person whom he has thereby
                disappointed, and the amount of the compensation shall be assessed on the value of
                the attempted disposition as at the date of the testator’s death, but shall not
                exceed the value of the gift bequeathed to the person electing to enforce his
                proprietary rights.<b>2. </b>Where
                property belongs to more than one person.  Where a testator purports to
                dispose of property which belongs to more than one person, every such person, if
                also a beneficiary under the will of that testator, shall have the right of election
                provided by paragraph 1, to the extent of his interest in that
                  property.<b>3. </b>Testator's
                ignorance immaterial.  It shall be immaterial to any case of election
                whether the testator, in purporting to dispose of property which is not his own, was
                aware of his lack of title, or proceeded on the erroneous supposition that he was
                exercising a power of disposition which belonged to
                  him.<b>4. </b>Legatee's ignorance
                material.  A person shall not be bound to elect until all circumstances
                which may influence his election are known to him, and, if a person elects in
                ignorance of any material facts, he shall not be bound by that
                  election.<b>5.</b> Implied election.
                 Where there is no express election, it may be implied or inferred from
                acts, or from failure to dissent, but such an inference shall not arise unless the
                legatee actually knows of his right to elect.<b>6.
                </b>Postponement in case of disability.  In case of any
                disability of a legatee entitled to elect, the election shall be postponed until the
                disability ceases, or until the election is made by some competent authority or
                  representative.<b>7. </b>Extrinsic
                evidence inadmissible to prove intention.  In order to raise a case of
                election the intention of the testator to dispose of the property not belonging to
                him must be apparent on the face of the will, and extrinsic evidence shall not be
                  admissible.<b>8. </b>Cases to which
                doctrine does not apply.  The principles of election set out in this
                Schedule shall not apply -  (a) to creditors;
                or (b) to legatees who hold the property of which the testator
                has attempted to dispose in some capacity other than that in which the gift is made
                to them; or (c) where the property of which the testator has
                attempted to dispose does not belong either to the testator or to the legatee, nor
                to any case where the legatee cannot by his own lawful act give effect to that
                disposition; or (d) where the legatee, although subsequently
                becoming the owner of the property of which the testator has attempted to dispose,
                is not the owner of that property at the date of the testator's death;
                or (e) to persons who, although taking no direct gift under
                the will, derive an indirect benefit
                  therefrom.<b>9. </b>Application to
                appointments under powers.  The principles of election set out in this
                Schedule shall apply to cases of invalid appointments under powers, but not where -
                 (a) the testator clearly shows he is aware that the
                appointment is of doubtful validity; (b) the appointment is
                made to objects of the power absolutely, with merely a condition or proviso in
                favour of strangers to the power; or (c) the appointment is
                void for remoteness.</p>

              <p><b>1. </b>Probate of copy or draft of lost will.
                 When a will has been lost or mislaid since the testator’s death, or has
                been destroyed by wrong or accident, and not by any act of the testator, and a copy

                where original exists.  When a will is in the possession of a person
                residing out of Kenya who has refused or neglected to deliver it up, but a copy has
                been transmitted to the executor, and it is necessary for the interests of the
                estate that probate should be granted without waiting for the arrival of the

              <p> ABATEMENT AND REFUNDING OF LEGACIES<em>
                  Abatement</em></p>
              <p><b>1. </b>Abatement of general legacies. (1)
                If the assets, after payment of debts, necessary expenses and specific legacies, are
                not sufficient to pay all the general legacies in full, the latter shall abate or be
                diminished in equal proportion, and the personal representative has no right to pay
                one legatee in preference to another nor to retain any money on account of legacy to
                himself or to any person for whom is a trustee:  Provided that
                nothing contained herein shall prejudice or affect the priority of the remuneration
                to which any personal representative may be entitled under the will (including any
                general legacy which is expressly or impliedly conditional on his proving the will)
                or otherwise. (2) For the purpose of abatement, a legacy for
                life, a sum appropriated by the will to produce an annuity, and the value of an
                annuity when no sum has been appropriated to produce it, shall be treated as general
                legacies. <b>2. </b> Non-abatement of
                specific legacy when assets sufficient to pay debts.  Where there is a
                specific legacy, and the assets are sufficient for the payment of debts and
                necessary expenses, the thing specified must be delivered to the legatee without any
                  abatement.<b>3. </b>Right under
                demonstrative legacy when assets sufficient to pay debts and necessary expenses.
                 Where there is a demonstrative legacy, and the assets are sufficient for
                the payment of debts and necessary expenses, the legatee shall have a preferential
                claim for payment of his legacy out of the fund from which the legacy is directed to
                be paid until the fund is exhausted, and if, after the fund is exhausted, part of
                the legacy still remains unpaid, he shall be entitled to rank for the remainder
                against the general assets as for a legacy of the amount of the unpaid
                  remainder.<b>4. </b>Rateable abatement
                of specific legacies. If the assets are not sufficient to answer the
                debts and the specific legacies, an abatement shall be made from the latter rateably
                in proportion to their respective amounts.<b>5.
                </b>Distribution after notice.  Where personal representatives
                have given such notice as may be prescribed for creditors and others to send in
                their claims against the estate of the deceased, the personal representatives shall,
                at the expiration of the time therein named for sending in claims, be at liberty to
                distribute the assets of the estate or any part thereof, in discharge of any lawful
                claims of which they have notice, and shall not be liable for the assets so
                distributed to any person of whose claim they have not had notice at the time of
                distribution: Provided that nothing herein contained shall
                prejudice the right of any creditor or claimant to follow the assets, or any part
                thereof, in the hands of the persons who may have received them
                respectively.</p>

                representatives. Where personal representatives have paid any legacy
                which, but for the payment, would have been liable to abatement in accordance with
                the foregoing provisions of this Schedule, they shall be entitled to call upon the
                legatee to refund the amount by which the legacy should have been
                abated- (a) if the legacy was paid under any order of the
                court; or (b) if and so far as the abatement is rendered
                necessary by discovery of a debt of which, notwithstanding compliance with the
                provisions of section 90 of this Act, the personal representatives had no notice at
                the time of voluntary payment of the legacy,  but not
                  otherwise.<b>7. </b>Creditors may call
                upon legatee to refund.  A creditor who has not received payment of his
                debt may call upon a legatee who has received payment of his legacy to refund the
                legacy, whether the assets of the testator's estate were or were not sufficient at
                the time of his death to pay both debts and legacies, and whether the payment of the
                legacy by the personal representatives was voluntary or
                  not.<b>8. </b>When legatee not
                satisfied or compelled to refund he cannot oblige one paid in full to refund.
                 If the assets of a testator's estate were sufficient to satisfy all the
                legacies at the time of the testator's death, a legatee who has not received payment
                of his legacy, or who has been compelled to refund the legacy in accordance with the
                provisions of paragraph 7, cannot oblige another legatee who has received payment in
                full to refund his legacy, whether that legacy was paid to him with or without suit,
                although the assets have subsequently become deficient by waste on the part of the
                personal representatives.<b>9. </b>When
                unsatisfied legatee must first proceed against personal representatives if solvent.
                If the assets of the testator's estate were not sufficient to satisfy all the
                legacies at the time of the testator's death, a legatee who has not received payment
                of his legacy shall, before he can call on a satisfied legatee to refund, first
                proceed against personal representatives, if they or any of them be solvent, but, if
                no personal representative be solvent or liable to pay, the unsatisfied legatee can
                oblige each satisfied legatee to refund in proportion:
                Provided that the refunding by one legatee to another shall not exceed the sum by
                which the satisfied legacy ought to have been abated if the estate had been properly
                administered.</p>
              <p><b>10. </b>Refund when legacy has become due
                on performance of condition within further time allowed. Where the time
                prescribed by the will for the performance of a condition has elapsed without the
                condition having been performed, and the personal representatives have thereupon,
                without fraud, distributed the assets of the testator's estate, in that case, if
                further time has for any reason been allowed by the court for the performance of the
                condition, and the condition has been performed accordingly, the legacy cannot be
                claimed from the personal representatives, but those to whom he has paid it shall be
                liable to refund the amount.<b>11.
                </b>Refunding to be without interest.  In all cases arising
                under this Schedule any refunding shall be without interest.</p>

                bequeathed shall, at or before the end of a year after the death of the testator, be
                invested in any authorized investment: Provided that, where an
                annuity is given and no fund is charged by the will with its payment or appropriated

                Where a gift is contingent, the personal representatives shall not be bound to
                invest the amount of the legacy, but may transfer the whole residue of the estate to
